              In this tutorial, I’ll share our insights into YouTube’s algorithm
              and viewer preferences on YouTube. I’ll also share tips for
              creating your own software YouTube channel, and advice from a
              variety of successful YouTube creators. Even if you are new to
              software, you can benefit a lot from starting a YouTube channel.

              Before you start a channel, you need to decide the goal of your
              channel. Your goal can have an impact on a lot of things about
              your channel.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some common goals (not mutually exclusive):</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Help others learn</li>
              <li>
                Build a body of work that will lead to other career
                opportunities
              </li>
              <li>Give you a reason to learn</li>
              <li>Promote a paid resource</li>
              <li>
                Make money through YouTube ad revenue, sponsorships, and

              Once you have decided on your goals and the style of videos you
              want to create, you should do some setup and planning. Here are
              some things you will have to do:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create the account for your YouTube channel.</li>
              <li>Determine your channel name.</li>
              <li>
                Design your channel icon, channel art, and general thumbnail
                style.
              </li>
              <li>Determine what kind of intro you want, if any.</li>
              <li>
                Consider what other consistent things you want to add to your
                videos to set them apart.
              </li>
              <li>Choose how frequently to upload.</li>

              Once you have done the high-level planning for your channel, it’s
              time to start planning the specific videos you will create.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good first step is brainstorming. Spend some time thinking and
              write out every idea you can possibly think of. Even bad ideas.
              Then start paring down the ideas to the best ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have you already written code that you could use for a tutorial
              video? Your past software projects can be inspiration for videos
              to create.

              Two of the most important things when it comes to recording are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a good microphone.</li>
              <li>
                If you are showing code on screen, make it as large as possible.

            </ul>
            <code>
              If you have bad audio or tiny code, it will cause people to stop
              watching immediately - before they even see the real content of
              your video.

              You can have the world's best video. But nobody will find out
              about it if they don’t click on the thumbnail.
            </p>
            <p>
              To grow your channel, it is important to create quality content.
              But it is almost equally important to use thumbnails and titles
              that will cause people to click on your video.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most types of videos, it's best to pick a title that people
              are searching for. There are two main ways to find what people are
              searching for:

              The YouTube algorithm is what determines what videos will be
              promoted and appear high in search results. It is a mysterious
              thing. Even top YouTubers talk about not completely understanding
              why the algorithm promotes some videos but not others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on some interviews I’ve heard, it is my belief that even
              YouTube engineers don’t completely understand the algorithm. The
              engineers tell the algorithm what outcome they want but they don’t
              specifically program how to achieve that outcome. That is handled
              by artificial intelligence and machine learning.

              When thinking about making money, you must know what your goals
              are. Some people are not concerned with making money from their
              videos and just want to provide free learning resources. However,
              most people aren’t able to spend time making learning resources
              unless they are compensated a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a few common ways that your software channel can make you
              money:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Getting you a job or a raise at work</li>

              <li>Post to relevant subreddits</li>
